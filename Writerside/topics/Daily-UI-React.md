# Daily UI Sketchbook

Daily UI is a collection of small interface and component experiments developed in both React and
Vue.  
The purpose of this workspace is to test SystemHaus token usage, evaluate component structures, and
explore interaction patterns in an isolated environment.

## Scope

The Daily UI workspace contains:

- React and Vue Storybooks
- component layout studies
- interaction and state-handling prototypes
- motion trials using Framer Motion (React) and Motion One (Vue)
- variations of token-driven styling (color, spacing, typography)
- isolated source folders for each experiment

Each experiment is self-contained and does not represent production code.

## Focus Areas

- SystemHaus token integration tests
- interaction behavior
- component ergonomics
- visual structure exploration
- small-scale motion experiments

Daily UI serves as an iterative space for evaluating UI decisions before they move into
design-system or product-level work.
