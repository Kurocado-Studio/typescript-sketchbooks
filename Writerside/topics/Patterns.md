# TS Patterns Sketchbook

TS Patterns is a set of isolated examples exploring front-end architecture and TypeScript modeling
for React and Vue.  
The workspace documents patterns that may later inform Platform packages, SystemHaus utilities, or
internal component design.

## Scope

This workspace includes examples of:

- render model patterns
- state-machine variants
- composition-based UI structures
- reusable TypeScript utility types
- data modeling tests
- React and Vue implementations for each pattern

Each pattern is intentionally small, focused, and framework-agnostic where possible.

---

## Focus Areas

- TypeScript-first architecture
- UI modeling techniques
- composable logic
- pattern comparison between React and Vue
- evaluation of maintainability and reusability

Patterns developed here are exploratory and not intended for direct production use.
