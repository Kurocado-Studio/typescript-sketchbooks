# Kurocado Studio TypeScript Sketchbooks

_Research and exploration across UI, architecture, and motion for the Kurocado Studio ecosystem._

The Sketchbooks monorepo is the internal R&D workspace for Kurocado Studio.  
It collects interface explorations, TypeScript pattern research, and motion studies developed in
both React and Vue. The purpose is to test ideas quickly, validate design-system decisions, and
refine architectural approaches before they move into production systems like SystemHaus, StyleBook,
FormKit, and the Platform monorepo.

## What Are the Sketchbooks?

Sketchbooks is a unified repository that houses three core disciplines:

- **[Daily UI](Daily-UI-React.md)** — interface explorations, component architecture studies, visual
  patterns, and SystemHaus token integration.
- **[Motion](Motion.md)** — animation system research using [Motion APIs](https://motion.dev/).
- **[TS Patterns](Patterns.md)** — TypeScript-first composition models, render strategies, and
  scalable front-end architecture patterns.

Everything begins as experimentation and evolves into reusable patterns, SystemHaus primitives, or
platform-level standards.

## Why Sketchbooks

### Exploration with Purpose

Sketchbooks allows the Studio to explore UI, architecture, and motion without production
constraints.

### Design-System Validation

SystemHaus tokens, scales, and component APIs are validated through real interface studies.

### Architecture Development

TypeScript modeling, state machines, and composition patterns are tested at small scale before
influencing Platform-level code.

### Motion Research

Transitions, pacing, timing scales, micro-interactions, and motion primitives are explored and
refined here.

### Cross-Framework Alignment

All explorations support both React and Vue to ensure consistency across the Studio ecosystem.

## How It Works

### For Design System Development

- Validate SystemHaus tokens and component APIs
- Test typographic, color, spacing, and radius scales
- Explore variations before formalizing production patterns

### For Engineering

- Document advanced patterns for React and Vue
- Explore TypeScript modeling and utility types
- Prototype render models, composition strategies, and state machines
- Test architecture decisions in isolation

### For Product Development

- Previsualize interaction flows
- Explore motion, pacing, and clarity
- Iterate on concepts quickly without affecting production code

## Core Areas

- Interface design studies
- Component architecture
- State modeling
- Motion systems and transitions
- TypeScript utility patterns
- React and Vue parity
- Token-driven visual language
- Interaction feedback and micro-interactions
- Experimental workflows and prototypes

## Part of the Kurocado Studio Ecosystem

Sketchbooks supports the Studio’s engineering foundation.  
Patterns validated here directly influence:

- **SystemHaus** — tokens, components, design primitives
- **StyleBook** — linting rules, coding standards, TypeScript configs
- **Platform** — architectural patterns, tooling, workflows
- **FormKit** — UI patterns, interactions, and rendering models

Sketchbooks acts as the experimental layer that feeds into the Studio’s production systems.
