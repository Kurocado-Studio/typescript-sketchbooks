Motion is a workspace dedicated to testing animation behavior in React and Vue.  
Experiments include transitions, interaction responses, gesture handling, and timing models.

## Scope

The Motion workspace includes:

- Motion examples for React & Vue
- timing and easing trials
- scroll and gesture-based interactions
- page and component transitions
- motion-system prototypes
- isolated folders for each experiment

Each item focuses on a single motion problem or behavior.

## Focus Areas

- timing and pacing
- repeatable motion primitives
- transition structure
- component-level feedback
- performance considerations

This workspace is used to evaluate motion approaches before introducing them into SystemHaus or
production UI.
